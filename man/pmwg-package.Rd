\description{
The pmwg package provides a general purpose implementation of the
sampling techniques outlined in Gunawan et al. (2020)
\doi{10.1016/j.jmp.2020.102368}. The user of this package is required to
provide their own log likelihood function, but given this the functions
provided can estimate model parameters, the full covariance matrix and
subject random effects in a hierarchical Bayesian way.
}
\section{Documentation}{

The documentation found at
contains background information and motivation for the approach used in
this package and several detailed examples of the package in action. It also
includes a list of common problems and associated troubleshooting steps.
}

\section{User input}{

The user is expected to provide a data source in a format that is compatible
with R data.frame methods. This data must have at least one column named
`subject` that has a unique identifier for each subject's data.

Additionally the user should provide a function that when given a set of
parameter estimates and the data for a single subject return the log of the
likelihood of that data given the parameter estimates.

The final piece of required information is a list of the names of each
parameter that should be estimated. There is also the capability to provide
priors on the model parameters, start points for the model parameters and
covariance matrix as well as options to fine tune the sampling process
